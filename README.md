## Introduction

In this project, we are working with big data of daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset. Here is [the link to our repo:](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI525_Group12). We first download the data from figshare to the local computer using the figshare API and then we combine data CSVs into a single CSV using pandas. Then we perform the EDA of summary statistics table of the min, max, mean, median and standard deviation of the all the columns. In R, we group by models to perform the summary statistics of EDA for the max rainfall, min rainfall, mean of rainfall and the median of rainfall across different models.
