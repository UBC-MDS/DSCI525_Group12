    "Milestone 2: Your team is planning to migrate to the cloud. AWS gave 400$ (100$ each) to your team to support this.

    "> Everything in this milestone is to be completed in sequential order. But if you want to divide the tasks, you can ask a team member to work on Task 2 (```4. Get the data that we wrangled in our first milestone.``` and ```6. Wrangle the data in preparation for machine learning```) locally on their laptop while the other members set up the infrastructure (EC2, S3) and TLJH in the cloud. This way, you can move quick.\n",
